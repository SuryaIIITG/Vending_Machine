Reset Logic: The reset condition if (rst) is now correctly scoped inside the always block that is triggered on either the positive edge of the clock or the reset signal. This ensures proper state initialization.
State Transitions: The transitions between states have been clarified, especially for handling the transition back to s0 with the correct change or product dispensed. The n_state now properly depends on the input and the current state.
Edge Case Handling: I've added default case handling to avoid any undefined behavior or latching in unexpected states.
Clarity in Behavior: Each state explicitly sets out and change based on the input and transitions. The machine will return the appropriate change or dispense the product depending on the input received.
